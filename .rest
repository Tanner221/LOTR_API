It is home to the hobbits, a small and friendly humanoid race known for their love of good food, comfort, and simple pleasures. The Shire is characterized by its rolling green hills, scattered villages, and hobbit-holes, which are underground dwellings built into the hills. Life in the Shire revolves around agriculture, with most hobbits working as farmers, gardeners, or brewers. The region is protected by a loose but effective government, led by the Thain and the Mayor.",
